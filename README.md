A simple implementation of Python code for a multi-agent version of the $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory with frustrated dynamics as a model of financial markets. The code is not optimized for computational efficiency but rather for clear communication of scientific results. To run the code one should create a folder named "draw" and run the commands in the "run" file.
